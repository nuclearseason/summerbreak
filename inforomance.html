	<div class="subtitle"></div>
	<div class="box"><p>I like that digital technology allows us to share more information with each other in quiet gestures of love. There are cons to increased ease of digital communication, like how my friends and I have free reign to text every insane thought that passes through our heads in real time, or how my hairless neighbor can shoot me a link to a <a href="/misc/jerritt.html">Dropbox album</a> (multi-folder, hierarchically categorized) of his own pornography, but in general there’s a unique romance to the whole thing. Messaging and email are strange and mysterious and exciting, a time-travel device to replay conversations, a third space where you’re allowed to look at each other without anyone knowing. I like that we’re able to send people links to other media, articles, songs, videos. It’s an indirect way of telling them, “I saw this and thought of you.” In particular, I find sending songs a profoundly intimate act, even if the string of characters in a Spotify link can’t explicitly express that. Music is so personal and vulnerable: here is some information from my soul. I am giving this knowledge for you to keep. Do with it what you will.</p></div>
	<div class="box">We do this, though, and find that digital communication platforms like to gatekeep. Built-in are obstacles like paywalls, nonskippable advertisements, required log-ins to services like Spotify and X and TikTok. I don’t have TikTok, so to watch anything from it, I have to switch my phone’s browser to desktop mode and wait for the (probably deliberately) sluggish interface to play me a twenty-second video. I know the clock is ticking—someday soon they’re going to erase that feature, and I’ll have to text a vague “lol!” in response to every TikTok link I get from acquaintances to avoid revealing my status as a twenty-three-year-old boomer. Plus, I only know that trick in the first place thanks to the years I spent growing up on the internet. To someone who doesn’t know about desktop mode, the barrier to watching short-form brainrot is much greater.</div>
	<div class="box">This is why, instead of gleefully opening these links, I tend to feel like <a href="https://archive.ph/20R40">I’ve been assigned homework</a>. Our attempts to foster connection through information-sharing are kept at bay by the interests of the corporation. I open the links anyway, because the person who sent this gesture of love deserves reciprocation. I refuse to succumb to digitally-enforced distance.</div>
	<div class="box">It’s worth mentioning I don’t usually <em>finish</em> looking at whatever people send me. There’s only so much time in a day; as much as I hate to be a cog in the machine, I have duties to upkeep to keep myself tethered to society, and ignoring them often leads to weirdly dramatic consequences. But also, honestly, I’m just not that interested sometimes. My attention span isn’t great—I did say I grew up on the internet. There’s too much information. I mourn the loss of my patience. </div>
	
	<div class="star"></div>

	<div class="box"><p>We’ve figured out by now that <a href="https://archive.ph/puctm">social media makes people feel lonelier than ever</a>, which is the opposite of its purported aim: to bring people together across time and space. In 2023, then-U.S. surgeon general Vivek Murthy identified <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf">loneliness as an epidemic</a> and wisely said loneliness “is as dangerous as smoking up to 15 cigarettes a day.” I actually don’t feel very lonely, so my takeaway from this information was that I should keep smoking cigarettes, clearly. According to this guy, I don’t even smoke that much—I could do it <em>more</em> and still be healthier than a lot of my generation. Good to know! In all seriousness, it’s not surprising we have a loneliness epidemic when we dedicate so much of our consciousness to the internet.</p></div>
	<div class="box">Ok, you say: get off social media. I say: this is impossible. I don’t use social media, <em>socially</em>—I keep a burner account with a gibberish handle on nearly every platform and never give out this info to anyone. I have to do this because I already know I’m cringey and obsessive and insecure, and I don’t actually care to know that much about other people (also, god forbid I have unfettered access to the online presence of someone I have a crush on)—but now nearly all organizations, public programs, school groups, etc. use Instagram to post events, updates, and general info. Twitter/X is arguably a major channel for journalism and real-time news. Facebook, while seen as some medieval artifact by those born post-9/11, is currently where the used goods market thrives. If you want to know things, if you can’t afford to pay for newspaper subscriptions and to buy everything new on Amazon, if you don’t have time to find a functioning indie alternative—you kind of have to use these platforms.</div>
	<div class="box">The same is true if you want to share information in an organized way. Social media, after all, is typically free. The same cannot be said for hosting your own website or publishing a book or even mailing letters. It’s less time-consuming as well, which helps if you’re one of those miserable people who need to have a job and wash their own dishes and everything. The “consolidated power and cultural influence” of these dominant technologies “make competition largely impossible,” Safiya Noble notes succinctly in her book, <em>Algorithms of Oppression</em>.  Because a few platforms have a monopoly over digital communication and knowledge, those who depend on the internet for their livelihoods—like people who build their careers on it, but also communities of color, queer communities, all whose histories and identities have been erased in local institutions—are forced to engage with them regularly.</div>
	<div class="box">Another point is that platforms that originally weren’t social media are now pseudo-social-media. Spotify is at its core a service for listening to music, but you can also see your friends’ listening habits. With the yearly Wrapped event in which users can share how many minutes they spent listening to music, it becomes a social network with a competitive air. You can track people’s running habits on Strava or whatever the heck it’s called (I don’t run). Even Google Maps and Apple’s Find My Friends are social, allowing you to monitor consenting contacts’ locations at all times. It’s silly and fun and promotes safety when used appropriately; I’ve had many a whimsical, spontaneous meet-up via Find My. At the same time, maybe we should question why <a href="https://archive.ph/dUtlA">we’ve normalized surveillance as a form of intimacy.</a></div>
	<div class="box">It’s clear we’re reliant on social media and digital technology. Even if we’re not reliant, we can’t escape it. That’s because this technology isn’t actually designed for human well-being. It’s designed to make us stay on it, consuming, consuming, consuming at our own risk.</div>
	<div class="box">See, technology isn’t neutral. It never has been. A program doesn’t create itself, and it’s not created in a void. Behind its design, production, use, and maintenance are people. People who live in a world manufactured by systems of oppression—what Patricia Hill Collins calls the <a href="https://soulellis.com/writing/tdc2021/">matrix of domination</a>, or the interlocking forces of white supremacy, capitalism, heteropatriarchy, and settler colonialism. We who create technology create it in this world. And as Noble writes, it’s becoming “increasingly difficult for technology companies to separate their systematic and inequitable employment practices, and the far-right ideological bents of some of their employees, from the products they make for the public.”</div>
	<div class="box">In the Musk-Meta era of misinformation, darlings of the internet are sites like Substack that supposedly <a href="https://archive.ph/YD4Y9">deplete less braincells</a> and impinge on less freedoms than pure social medias. Still, Substack is just another example of technology that reinforces the matrix of domination. There are a number of popular newsletters that routinely publish white supremacist writing and other hateful rhetoric; <a href="https://archive.ph/uyugO">Substack allows this to happen</a>. As a result, writers and readers of those targeted communities are given a choice. Leave the platform voluntarily and become separated from yet another mainstream information resource, from other people, or stay on a platform that profits from your harm.</div>
	<div class="box">In her essay “<a href="https://pioneerworks.org/broadcast/hannah-
baer-loneliness">On Loneliness</a>,” Hannah Baer argues that loneliness is systemic. “Loneliness is partly what it’s like to be a subject in an economic system where your emotional needs are either externalities to be minimized or incentives to be fused with commerce in an architecture of exploitation and extraction,” she says. “It’s systemic, you’re lonely because the system is broken. Another world is possible.”</div>
	<div class="box">The technology we use is shaped to exclude the marginalized. At the same time, we’re left little choice but to continue using these technologies. So when digital platforms are such a significant part of how we interact and develop socially in the twenty-first century, the marginalized are lonelier. Loneliness <em>is</em> systemic.</div>

	<div class="star"></div>
	
	<div class="box">bell hooks observed in 1999 that people have a cynicism about love rooted in a “pervasive feeling that love cannot be found.” This is still true, twenty-six years later. Are we done for, then? If it was that bad in the 90s, how are we supposed to Love in the Time of Techolera? My answer: we should expand our definition of love. Create more sub-categories for it. For instance, I’m not sure if I’ve truly fallen in love with someone yet, so I’ll save that definition for later, when I do. It’s a different definition of love compared to the one I use with family, which is always listed in my mind-dictionary alongside the word <em>grief</em>. My most radiant love is platonic love for friends, and there’s also this unexpected love you have for strangers, acquaintances, and the in-betweens, who surprise you into affection. There’s love for nature and art and coincidence and everything else and here’s a secret. You can love whatever and whoever you want. No one has to know.</div>
	<div class="box">Thing is, you don’t need to be loved back to be in love. I think love mostly means respect. I also think you might think I’m crazy. But what, I’m supposed to be normal? In this economy? Being in love, paying attention and <em>respect</em> to people and details and the music that is created daily in the world, is what keeps me here still. It makes you look at information differently, makes you want to create things, makes you more confident in what you want and know. We need that, when we’re so used to being drawn apart and shut off by oppressive technology without even noticing it.</div>
	<div class="box">I don’t mean to say we should stop using tech; I mean to say we should change the world it’s being built in. A world in which we are freer to share information with each other. In this world, we are not so lonely. It will take a while. Until then, I’ll keep listening to the songs you send me.</div>
