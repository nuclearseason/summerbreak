		<div class="caption">November 2005 / San Francisco — Golden Gate Park? One month after moving to the United States. I’m the overexcited child in pigtails on the right.</div>
	<div class="box"><p>Every Friday, my dad sends old photos of us in the family group chat. This is a fairly recent development. For whatever reason, the photo printing service Shutterfly, which my dad used around a decade ago to create a series of photobooks, began to email him every Friday with reminders of what he had once uploaded to his account. He had never bothered to delete them, so they live in the cloud-archive. And now, whenever he gets them, he texts them to us.</p></div>
	<div class="photo"><img src="lingua02.JPEG" width="600px"></div>
	<div class="caption">Date unknown / Seattle — Pike Place Market. With my older cousin, visiting from Korea. Years later I would rediscover a magnet my parents had bought here; it’s now affixed to my fridge.</div>
	<div class="box"><p>My family is dysfunctional (what is family if not?) for a lot of reasons, but I think the main reason is the fact that we moved from Korea to California when I was young and have fallen prey to the language barrier that developed ever since. I didn’t fully learn how to speak my native tongue, and as a result, I didn’t learn how to express myself to my parents. It evolved into a full-blown inability to truly talk to them, to have conversations, to allow them to know who I am and what I dream of. My older sister is less of a victim of this language barrier, having learned more Korean before coming to the U.S., but she doesn’t talk to our parents in the way normal children do, either. I can only guess the reasons why, because I’m obviously never going to ask her. The Korean-English barrier was so effective it produced an English-English barrier in this family too. Simply put, our relationships are a mess. No one knows how to talk to each other.</p>

	<p>Today I am twenty-three years old and as far as my memory goes back I have said “I love you” to my mom once, around a year ago. Through text, that is. My dad has yet to receive this luxury. I do love them. It took me over two decades to come to this conclusion. I just can’t say it.</p></div>
	<img src="lingua03.JPEG" width="600px">
	<div class="caption">Date unknown / San Francisco — Palace of Fine Arts, I think. I still wear that heart-shaped hair clip, though it looks much smaller now because my head is dramatically bigger. Also, is that Coke in a bottle?</div>
	<div class="box"><p>So instead, I try to give my love more indirectly. When my dad sends these photos, I try as best as I can with my stunted Korean and stunted emotional capacity to express my appreciation. Of course, my limited language skill is never enough to show how precious the photos are to me. In them, I am a child, wearing clothes of a distinctly Korean fashion my mother picked out for me that have since been discarded. My sister and I are holding hands so naturally. What that feels like, I can’t remember. We’re both smiling, something I stopped doing a few years later once I learned self-consciousness. My moms’s hair isn’t grey and my dad’s hairline isn’t receded. (In fact, I think that was his primary motivation for sending these photos to us in the first place. To prove that there existed a time before he was a balding man.)</p>
	<p>These are records of who each of us were, what we looked like, and what we did, but they’re also proof that we have, actually, enjoyed a great amount of time together, as a family, in many cities and seasons. And maybe we can’t go back to that place, but at least we can remember we were once there.</p></div>

	<div class="caption">Date unknown / Monterey — Monterey Bay Aquarium. You’ve noticed I don’t know the dates for any of these photos since the first one. I could literally just ask my dad, but doing even that is hard.</div>
	<div class="box">
		<p>For a family that doesn’t know how to communicate, records of our lives together tend to be what keep us connected. Conversations between us are products of discernible effort, so the record, which is effortless—a byproduct—acts as an aid. It visibly or audibly acknowledges our relationships and is a way to hold onto each other, without explicitly admitting it, when we have grown apart. While it’s difficult to create new memories, there’s relief in the proof of our old ones.</p>
		<p>I have virtually no recollection of the events captured in these photos. Yet to my parents, once those memories are jogged, it’s as if they happened yesterday (or so they say). The same image produces a different effect for each person. We all read it a little differently, remember it a little differently.</p>
		<p>There’s something to say here about the generative and interpretive power of a record. The word <em>record</em> itself evokes a sense of neutrality, objectivity, in the same way the words <em>evidence</em> and <em>data</em> are supposed to. Thinking about my family’s split pespectives on our photos, though, I find that a record often takes on several subjective meanings and generates more still.</p>
		<p>Which I appreciate, because sometimes these records are the result of painful experiences. It’s not that I want to erase that pain. I just want to see that I’ve arrived at love despite it.</p>

	<div class="caption"><p>Date unknown / Millbrae — a house on Helen Drive across Meadows Elementary School. My mom and dad in our living room. The stockings above the fireplace in the background suggest it was around Christmas, but there’s also a high chance we left them hanging there year-round the entire time we lived there. I watched my first Korean drama on that TV behind them, an activity that would become a core (and damaging, frankly) facet of my childhood.</p>
	<p>Were my parents happy when this was taken? With their lives, and each other? I grew up wondering why my parents ever married. To this day it baffles me, though their separation has ceased to be a looming possibility. It does look like they’re forcing their smiles here, but then again sometimes a photo just comes out like that.
	<p>A record can prove that something happened, but it doesn’t always tell you the how or why. Especially when the record is a photo, which can be manipulated by the performance of the subjects. I’m left to interpret this how I like. And even though we probably weren’t, I would like to imagine we were happy, all of us.</p></div>
